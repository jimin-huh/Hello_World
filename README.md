Hello!

My name is Jimin Huh.
I am currently a junior at the University of Iowa, Tippie college of Business, majoring in Business Analytics and Information System.
I am a person who is full of passion even with the small thing.
I have a great leadership, which made me have a role as a president for 2 organizations in college.
I especially like to cuddle with my little cat Sando (trust me, he is SO CUTE).
